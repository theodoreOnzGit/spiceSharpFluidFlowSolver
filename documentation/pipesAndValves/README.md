## Code Design Philosophy

For this pipes and valves code
its purpose is ultimately
to act as a component that can be put into any 
regular circuit which is an IEntityCollection.

### Solid Principles

As far as possible, i will be using solid principles,
the dependency injection pattern and loose coupling
as well as the factory pattern to instantiate 
objects.

### Procedural and Functional Programming

However, solid principles are sometimes 
[overkill](https://youtu.be/IRTfhkiAqPw)
for code that does not need to change. In fact
overdoing it can 
[obfuscate](https://youtu.be/QM1iUe6IofM) the code.
